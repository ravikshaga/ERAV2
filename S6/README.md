Tried a bunch of things constraining myself to <20k parameters (# of conv layers, ativation functions, BN, Dropout, GAP, FC layer, antman etc etc.)
Max accuracy I got was around 98.5%, and could not optimize it any further.

The proceess of optimizing for these parameters feflt a bit arbitrary (trial and error) for me at this point. 
I am hoping that with time, I get a more "intuitive feel" on choosing the right parameters.
