This is a repo for ERAV2 S5 assignment. This was an excellent way to get my hands dirty at building a new model from scratch.
The contents of this repo include
- model.py (model definition)
- utils.py (includes train, test helper functions)
- S5.ipynb (top level python notebook for training/testing the model)
-
